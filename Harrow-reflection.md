What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
* Push/Pull were fuzzy for me. Also how things were supposed to flow from local branch to Github branch to Github master and maybe to the local master at some point. That was all super fuzzy.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
* First and foremost, I feel like I have a good idea of how pairing actually works.
* I have a pretty good grasp on push/pull and the git flow.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
* I asked about some of the things regarding pushing to Github and pulling back down to both of them. Asked the guide specifically about how to think about pairing.

What still confuses you about Git?
* Fetch and merge. I kind of get it, but don't understand why I wouldn't just use pull.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
* Pretty good. It was super frustrating when Github went down and we had to reschedule to complete it. Otherwise, I think it went well. I definitely learned a lot and had a good experience with both my pair and the guide.
